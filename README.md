# Code Refactor for Accessibility Standards

Provided a given code of a landing page for a hypothetical company, I was tasked to refactor the code to meet accessibility standards and search engine optimization. In addition, I was to clean up the code originally provided to improve legibility and consistency. I fixed broken links, rearranged the CSS layout, and included comments where necessary. 

Below is the user story and acceptance criteria provided:
